gst-launch -v  videotestsrc ! video/x-raw-yuv,  width=640, height=
480 ! TIVidenc1 codecName=h264enc engineName=codecServer ! udpsink host= <host IP> port=5000
took up 90% of my cpu.
when i ran the same on 320X240 it took 30% of my cpu.
 

E-con 3.2MP camera, overo fire FE.

gst-launch -v v4l2src ! video/x-raw-yuv,width=640,height=480,framerate=30/1 ! TIVidenc1 codecName=h264enc engineName=codecServer !  udpsink host=192.168.80.110 port=10000

Considering

gst-launch -v  videotestsrc ! video/x-raw-yuv,  width=640, height=480 framerate=30/1 ! fakesink sync=false silent=true

takes up 90% of the CPU by itself, I don't think videotestsrc is a good test of CPU usage.



I'm testing with an Overo Tide running at 720 MHz. Kernel 2.6.32-psp 
with 'task-gstreamer-ti' and my driver added to a slimmed down 
omap3-console-image.

I am running this command on the gumstix

gst-launch v4l2src ! video/x-raw-yuv, width=640, height=480 ! smokeenc ! udpsink host=192.168.10.4 port=4000

And this on the workstation (192.168.10.4)

gst-launch udpsrc port=4000 ! smokedec ! autovideosink




I'm using 2.6.38-rc8 (a5abba989deceb731047425812d268daf7536575) from the 
mainline kernel (so, not linux-omap) with one additional DSP patch. The 
patch will probably be in the 2.6.38.1.

I have the DSP and host USB working on my Summit board with Overo Fire 
but I haven't tried e.g. SGX or display and I think my config has some 
problems with the USB OTG.

Anyway, my stuff can be found from here:

There are some dsp tools that allows you to e.g. ping the DSP to see 
that the communication is working properly.

I'm using the gst-dsp that came with the MeeGo for encoding the video 
from my webcam.
