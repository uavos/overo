Download and extract this archive to your over-oe directory: http://iconux.org/files/oe/user.collection_overo_pm.tar.gz

Then run

bitbake -b user.collection/recipes/linux/linux-omap-pm_2.6.38.bb

This should download the pm kernel from git and build the kernel.

Note:  The resulting kernel has sound disabled and the usb is "off".



change the console to use ttyO2 instead of ttyS2?  For whatever reason, the serial ports on the omap are referred to now as ttyO# instead of ttyS#.   This change was made sometime around 2.6.37-rc3 or so...
